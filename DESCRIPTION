Title: Gene Set Association Analysis
Version: 0.81
Authors@R: person("Christoph", "Rau", email = "chrau@ucla.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: GSAA finds associations between weighted gene sets and GO Terms
    by using a GWAS-like approach of associating the weights (a 'phenotype') of
    individual genes ('samples') to a GO Term (a 'SNP'). The Analysis is capable of
    recovering significantly improved associations between gene groups and GO Terms,
    especially for smaller datasets which can be expanded due to weighting.
